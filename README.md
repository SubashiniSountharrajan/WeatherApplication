# Weather Application

This is a simple **Weather Application** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to get current weather information based on their city input. The application integrates with a weather API to fetch real-time data and displays it in a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my skills in working with **JavaScript** for fetching data from an API and dynamically updating the UI. It also showcases my ability to design a clean, responsive interface using **HTML** and **CSS**.

### Features
